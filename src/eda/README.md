# Easy Data Augmentation 

- Run the cell blocks with the paths updated to generate the input files necessary for EDA. 
- Once the files are generated, clone the EDA repo avaialable  [here](https://github.com/jasonwei20/eda_nlp).
- Follow the instructions given in the repo to generate the data 
- Once the data is generated, we convert it back to the original representation so as to keep the input to training pipeline consistent. 
- This data can now be used to train the model and evaluate it against the locked test set.
